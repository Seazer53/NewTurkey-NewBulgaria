In the east, USSR try to influence every country in the world. Turkey has to choose its side. It's unlikely to get rid of those threats with neutrality. Father of the Turks will lead them!"
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Our country humiliated after the World War I. After the peace treaty we never find a 'peace'. Coups, communists, crisis have destabilized our country.
