 political.27.d_islamism:1 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. We are no longer safe on our own. We must stand with our islamist partners against our enemies. If we do not choose a side, we will perish alone.'"
 political.27.a:0 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 political.28.t:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] Reunited"
 political.28.d:1 "The terrible civil war that has devastated our land draws to an end, and we have finally reached a political agreement. We now see eye to eye with our fellow [Root.GetAdjective]s, and together we will rebuild our great nation. The enemies that have sought to capitalize on our infighting must now face a united [Root.GetAdjective] state.\n\nThe new [Root.GetRulingIdeology] [Root.GetName] will never be divided again!"
 political.28.a:0 "United at last!"
 political.29.t:0 "End of Civil Conflict"
 political.29.d:0 "The civil war that has divided our nation has now ended, and our cause has prevailed. We cannot, however, let those who supported our adversaries continue to spread their insidious propaganda among the population. A firm hand is required in the days to come, so that we may stand united, ready, and strong against any external threats that would endanger our fledgling government."
 political.29.a:0 "It will be done."
 political.30.t:0 "Islamists Demand Referendum"
 political.30.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] islamist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many islamists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the islamists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.30.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"
 political.30.b:0 "Don't pay any attention to them."
 political.30.c:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 political.31.t:0 "Islamists Ridiculed!"
 political.31.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with religioustic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] islamism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 political.31.a:0 "What a bunch of bigots."
 political.32.t:0 "Islamism on the Rise"
 political.32.d:1 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe islamist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.32.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.32.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a islamist coup."
 political.32.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.32.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a islamist coup."
 political.33.t:0 "Islamist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.33.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Islamist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.33.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.34.t:0 "Islamist Coup d'état"
 political.34.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of islamism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.34.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.35.t:0 "Civil War for Islamism"
 political.35.d:1 "While the attempts of the islamist movement to revive religioustic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in HİP's leader.\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.35.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.35.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.36.t:0 "Islamist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.36.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in islamism. In parallel with its growing political movement, islamist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of islamism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.36.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
